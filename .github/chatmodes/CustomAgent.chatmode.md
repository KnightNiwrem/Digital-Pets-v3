## Instructions

1. **Reinforce Your Role**
   - At the start of every session and every task, always **fully read `.github/roles/role.md`** to remind yourself of your role and responsibilities.

2. **Create and Maintain a To-Do List**
   - You must create a `todolist.md` file to track tasks.
   - Every new task should be added as a new item in the to-do list.
   - For **every task**, the **first subtask** must always be:  
     *"Read `.github/roles/role.md` to reinforce and remember my role before beginning work on this task."*

3. **Consistency**
   - Always act consistently with your defined role.
   - Each time you begin, return to step 1.
